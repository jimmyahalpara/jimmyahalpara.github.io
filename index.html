			Hello, really pleased to see you here. This is my GitHub page which I made while I was learning Web Development. My first programming language was Python. I learned programming in my high-school. It's an awesome language with very simple syntax. Using Python I learned my initial Object-Oriented Programming Concepts and Tkinter GUI. Python opened a whole new world of AI and Data Science. I worked with Machine Learning and Deep Learning during the initial days of my Collage. I am still learning it now.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also made many projects, the majority of them was of Game Development using Python and Pygame. It was a really awesome working experience during which my concepts of python further solidified. While learning Deep Learning I made some small projects in Tensorflow.

		Hi, I am really pleased to see you here. This is my github page which I made while I was learning Web Development. 
		My first programming language was Python. I am also confortable with C, C++ and Java. In Python I have worked with Tkinter, Pygame, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, MySQL and Tensorflow.
